# Personal-Auth
Here I built a full stack app with 0authorization. User get's to login to exisiting account or creat an account, applciaiton allows users to enter journal entries for personal use rather than the old tactic of paper and pen journaling.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
*CSS
*JavaScript
*Express
*Node
*Monogo DB

## Lessons Learned
Focusing on coding full stack applications has allowed me to become more familair on creating and using databases, as well as being more familair with using express wireframe.
